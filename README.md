# Rapid Troubleshooting - Angular Edition

So Steve's back.  Somehow he got back in the manager's good graces by claiming he was an "Angular Ninja" or "Pirate"...or something.  Anyway, Steve is currently "finding himself" in the jungles of the Amazon, and the manager still needs to present the result of Steve's Angular research to the C-levels tomorrow.

All the mananger needs to show is a basic Angular proof of concept, to show how easy it is to set up.  Unfortunately, it looks like Steve cargo-culted the living crap out of a couple tutorials, never tested anything, and then just walked away.

It is up to you to make the apps look like the final products you are about to see.

It is **highly encouraged** to use your Developer Tools' Elements and Console tabs to debug these issues.

Here are the two projects Steve was supposed to accomplish:

### Project 1: Hello World

All we need to do is print out the string `You did it!` to the HTML page.  Easier said than done, though.  Steve left us a mess here.

### Project 2 (Stretch): Router

The C-levels have heard great things about "Front End Routing". Steve **tried** to research this, copied a bunch of code that doesn't work, and sent it to the manager's inbox.  See if you can get the `Home` and `About` links to work on the page, as well as a welcome text to show up on the HTML like in project 1.

### Get your Stuff Together, Steve
